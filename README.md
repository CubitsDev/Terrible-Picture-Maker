# Terrible Picture Maker
I made a small picture maker for my terrible drawings as an inside joke with some friends.

# Config
If you want to use this yourself, start by making some terrible drawings!

Then chuck them all in your /images/ folder and edit index.js

Change the config Object near the top to list all your images you want to use. It's setup to be in a format of imagename then the filename. Make sure to include the file extension.
